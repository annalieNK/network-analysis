    "# Dataset Spotlight: How ISIS Uses Twitter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset includes 17,000 tweets from 100+ pro-ISIS fanboys from all over the world since the November 2015 Paris Attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The columns describe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name**\n",
    "- Username\n",
    "- Description\n",
    "- Location\n",
    "- Number of followers at the time the tweet was downloaded\n",
    "- Number of statuses by the user when the tweet was downloaded\n",
    "- Date and timestamp of the tweet\n",
    "- The tweet itself\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on this data, these are some examples for deriving insights and analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Social Network Cluster Analysis:** Who are the major players in the pro-ISIS twitter network? Ideally, we would like this visualized via a cluster network with the biggest influencers scaled larger than smaller influencers.\n",
    "- **Keyword Analysis:** Which keywords derived from the name, username, description, location, and tweets were the most commonly used by ISIS fanboys? Examples include: \"baqiyah\", \"dabiq\", \"wilayat\", \"amaq\"\n",
    "- **Data Categorization of Links:** Which websites are pro-ISIS fanboys linking to? Categories include: Mainstream Media, Altermedia, Jihadist Websites, Image Upload, Video Upload,\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis:** Which clergy do pro-ISIS fanboys quote the most and which ones do they hate the most? Search the tweets for names of prominent clergy and classify the tweet as positive, negative, or neutral and if negative, include the reasons why. Examples of clergy they like the most: \"Anwar Awlaki\", \"Ahmad Jibril\", \"Ibn Taymiyyah\", \"Abdul Wahhab\". Examples of clergy that they hate the most: \"Hamza Yusuf\", \"Suhaib Webb\", \"Yaser Qadhi\", \"Nouman Ali Khan\", \"Yaqoubi\".\n",
    "- **Timeline View:** Visualize all the tweets over a timeline and identify peak moments\n",

Formally, the algorithm tries to maximize the modularity of network, or the fraction of edges that fall within the community minus the expected fraction of edges if the edges were distributed by random. Good communities should have a high number of intra-community edges, so by maximizing the modularity, we detect dense communities that have a high fraction of intra-community edges.\n",
