**The notebooks cover, or will cover, the following subtopics:**

- What seems typical about this network? Who are the influencers in the network, and who are mainly receivers of tweets?


- Where do people talk about?
- Which members of the network talk about many topics and which members about only selective topics?
- Which topics are related?
- Can we identify cliques based on the subject of their conversation?
- Can we identify a pattern of the frequency of a particular topic over time? Which users started to spread a particular topic, or started to use particular key features?

The data that is used in this project is a Kaggle dataset: "How ISIS Uses Twitter".

I got inspired to analyse this network by the interview with Khuram Zaman, who created a Twitter dataset to analyse the behavior of a pro-ISIS network on Twitter. 

I have been particularly interested in social behavior and the influence of group behavior on the exchange of information. This dataset is elaborative enough to start my research to investigate online social behavior and especially to explore what we could learn from the structure of this network.
